# Sentiment-Analysis

The presentation will be related to a research project that you will develop from scratch. The main goal of this project is to develop something by yourselves related to sentiment analysis. If you have a project that you are interest in working on and it is relevant for a retrieval information system we can always talk about it. <br>
Presentations will be on <b>November 27th and 29th.</b> <br>
Deadline -> <b>27th November before the class</b> <br>
Deliverables:<br>
1.- To make a research about what sentiment analysis is and why is that relevant for a retrieval system. <br>
2.- To implement the proof of concept, showing an example of how does that work.<br>

-Every person in each team have to talk at least a third of the total time for teams with three people and half of the time for teams of two people. All presentation will be fully in English and I highly recommend you to make a presentation using slides. <br>
