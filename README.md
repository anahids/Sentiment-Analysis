# Sentiment-Analysis

The presentation will be related to a research project that you will develop from scratch. The main goal of this project is to develop something by yourselves related to sentiment analysis. If you have a project that you are interest in working on and it is relevant for a retrieval information system we can always talk about it. 
Presentations will be on November 27th and 29th.
